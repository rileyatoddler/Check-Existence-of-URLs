# Check-Existence-of-URLs
A mini project - check if a string of urls exist or not


direcly applicable to any groups of urls with formats like:
www.example.com/1
www.example.com/2
www.example.com/3

otherwise you plan compile a list of website and write ur own code but function checkWebsiteExists should be working
